# üåü Exercise 1: Cats

#   Instantiate three Cat objects using the code provided above.
#   Outside of the class, create a function that finds the oldest cat and returns the cat.
#   Print the following string: ‚ÄúThe oldest cat is <cat_name>, and is <cat_age> years old.‚Äù. Use the function previously created.

# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs

# Create a class called Dog.

# üåü Exercise 3 : Who‚Äôs the song producer?

# Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
